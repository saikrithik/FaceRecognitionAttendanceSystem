MakeSure to create a file name called Attendance in the desktop and
save its address in the Markingattendance program:

Save your photos using StoringImages and Enter the names of the stored data as per names in the below
attendance.xlsx sheet. (or else the program cannot mark attendance)

create a excel file with the students data such as (STUDENT NAMES,Roll-no.,etc)
and save it as attendance.xlsx (this is to take the reference to mark attendance)


Store your groupface images in "./groupphotos/".

MarkAttendance takes the photos from groupphotos and crop each face in to test folder and then test it
and marks attendance.

TestRealTime.py - It detects 1 face at a time in realtime with high accuracy rate
RealTimeTest.py - It detects multiple faces at a time in real time with lesser accurate
